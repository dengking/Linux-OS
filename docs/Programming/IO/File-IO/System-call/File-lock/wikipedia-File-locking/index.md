# wikipedia [File locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking)

**File locking** is a mechanism that restricts access to a [computer file](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Computer_file) by allowing only one [user](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-User_(computing)) or [process](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Computer_process) to access it in a specific time.



Most [operating systems](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Operating_system) support the concept of [record locking](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Record_locking), which means that individual records within any given file may be locked, thereby increasing the number of [concurrent](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Concurrency_(computer_science)) update processes.
