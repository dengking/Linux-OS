## wikipedia [OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)

**OS-level virtualization** refers to an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) paradigm in which the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)) allows the existence of multiple isolated [user space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space) instances. Such instances, called **containers** ([Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers), [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))), **Zones** ([Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_Containers)), **virtual private servers** ([OpenVZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ)), **partitions**, **virtual environments** (VEs), **virtual kernel** ([DragonFly BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vkernel)), or **jails** ([FreeBSD jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD_jail) or [chroot jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot_jail)),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization#cite_note-1) may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them. A computer program running on an ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders, [network shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_resource), CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of a container can only see the container's contents and devices assigned to the container.

On [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems, this feature can be seen as an advanced implementation of the standard [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) mechanism, which changes the apparent root folder for the current running process and its children. In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often provides [resource-management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_management_(computing)) features to limit the impact of one container's activities on other containers.

The term *"container,"* while most popularly referring to OS-level virtualization systems, is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to fuller [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) environments operating in varying degrees of concert with the host OS, e.g. [Microsoft's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) *"[Hyper-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V) Containers."*
