# 1.6.2. Process Implementation

To let the kernel manage processes, each process is represented by a *process descriptor* that
includes information about the current state of the process.

When the kernel stops the execution of a process, it saves the current contents of several processor
registers in the process descriptor. These include:

- The program counter (PC) and stack pointer (SP) registers
- The general purpose registers
- The floating point registers
- The processor control registers (Processor Status Word) containing information about the CPU
  state
- The memory management registers used to keep track of the RAM accessed by the process

When the kernel decides to resume executing a process, it uses the proper **process descriptor fields**
to load the CPU registers. Because the stored value of the **program counter** points to the instruction
following the last instruction executed, the process resumes execution at the point where it was
stopped.

When a process is not executing on the CPU, it is waiting for some event. Unix kernels distinguish many **wait states**, which are usually implemented by **queues of process descriptors** ; each (possibly
empty) queue corresponds to the set of processes waiting for a specific event.
