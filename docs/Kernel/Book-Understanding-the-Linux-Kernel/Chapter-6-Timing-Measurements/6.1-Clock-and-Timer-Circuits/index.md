# 6.1. Clock and Timer Circuits

On the 80x86 architecture, the kernel must explicitly interact with several kinds of **clocks** and **timer** circuits. The **clock circuits** are used both to keep track of the current time of day and to make precise time measurements. The **timer circuits** are programmed by the kernel, so that they issue interrupts at a fixed, predefined frequency; such periodic interrupts are crucial for implementing the **software timers** used by the kernel and the user programs. We'll now briefly describe the clock and hardware circuits that can be found in IBM-compatible PCs.
