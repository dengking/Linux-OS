The **memory management** in the operating system is an essential functionality, which allows the allocation of memory to the processes for execution and deallocates the memory when the process is no longer needed. In this article, we will discuss two memory management schemes **paging** and **segmentation**. The basic difference between **paging** and **segmentation** is that, “page” is a fixed-sized block whereas, a “segment” is a variable-sized block.

> NOTE : 其实，这个差别就决定了segment是需要记录下它的每个block的size的，而page显然不需要

We will discuss some more differences between **Paging** and **Segmentation** with the help of comparison chart shown below.

### Definition of Paging

**Paging** is a **memory management scheme**. Paging allows a process to be stored in a memory in a **non-contiguous** manner. Storing process in a non-contiguous manner solves the problem of **external** **fragmentation**.

For implementing paging the **physical and logical memory spaces** are divided into the same fixed-sized blocks. These fixed-sized blocks of physical memory are called **frames**, and the fixed-sized blocks of logical memory are called **pages**.

***SUMMARY*** :注意**pages**和**frames**的含义是不同的；

When a process needs to be executed the **process pages** from logical memory space are loaded into the **frames** of physical memory address space. Now the address generated by **CPU** for accessing the frame is divided into two parts i.e. **page number** and **page offset**.

The **page table** uses **page number** as an index; each **process** has its separate **page table** that maps **logical address** to the **physical address**. The **page table** contains base address of the page stored in the frame of physical memory space. The base address defined by page table is combined with the page offset to define the frame number in physical memory where the page is stored.



### Definition of Segmentation

Like Paging, **Segmentation** is also a **memory management scheme**. It supports the user’s view of the memory. The process is divided into the **variable size segments** and loaded to the **logical memory address space**.



The **logical address space** is the collection of variable size segments. Each segment has its **name** and **length**. For the execution, the **segments** from **logical memory space** are loaded to the **physical memory space**.



![segmentation](https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Segmentation.jpg)



The address specified by the user contain two quantities the **segment name** and the **Offset**. The segments are numbered and referred by the **segment number** instead of segment name. This segment number is used as an index in the **segment table**, and **offset** value decides the length or **limit** of the segment. The segment number and the offset together combinely generates the address of the segment in the physical memory space.



## Key Differences Between Paging and Segmentation

1. The basic difference between paging and segmentation is that a page is always of **fixed block size** whereas, a segment is of **variable size**.
2. Paging may lead to **internal fragmentation** as the page is of fixed block size, but it may happen that the process does not acquire the entire block size which will generate the internal fragment in memory. The segmentation may lead to **external fragmentation** as the memory is filled with the variable sized blocks.
3. In paging the user only provides a **single integer** as the address which is divided by the hardware into a **page number and Offset**. On the other hands, in segmentation the user specifies the address in two quantities i.e. **segment number and offset**.
4. The size of the page is decided or specified by the **hardware**. On the other hands, the size of the segment is specified by the **user**.
5. In paging, the **page table** maps the **logical address to the physical address**, and it contains base address of each page stored in the frames of physical memory space. However, in segmentation, the **segment table** maps the **logical address to the physical address**, and it contains segment number and offset (segment limit).



### Conclusion:

Paging and segmentation both are the **memory management schemes**. Paging allows the memory to be divided into **fixed sized block** whereas the segmentation, divides the memory space into **segments of the variable block size**. Where the paging leads to **internal fragmentation** the segmentation leads to **external fragmentation**.
