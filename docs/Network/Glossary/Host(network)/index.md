# Host

## wikipedia [Host (network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network))

A **network host** is a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). A host may work as a [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address).

A computer participating in networks that use the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) may also be called an **IP host**. Specifically, computers participating in the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) are called **Internet hosts**, sometimes *Internet nodes*. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at startup by means of the [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) (DHCP), or by [stateless address autoconfiguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_address_autoconfiguration) methods.

Network hosts that participate in applications that use the [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server_model) of computing, are classified as [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) or [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)) systems. Network hosts may also function as nodes in [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) applications, in which all nodes share and consume resources in an equipotent manner.

### Origins

In [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems), the term *terminal host* denotes a [time-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) computer or [multi-user software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-user_software) providing services to [computer terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal), or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)#cite_note-1) such as a [mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)serving [teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype) terminals or video terminals. Other examples of this architecture include a [telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) host connected to a telnet server and an [xhost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhost) connected to an [X Window client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System).

The term *Internet host* or just *host* is used in a number of [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) (RFC) documents that define the Internet and its predecessor, the [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET). [RFC 871](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc871) defines a host as a general-purpose computer system connected to a communications network for "... the purpose of achieving resource sharing amongst the participating operating systems..."[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network)#cite_note-rfc871-2)

While the ARPANET was being developed, computers connected to the network were typically mainframe（大型机） computer systems that could be accessed from [dumb terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumb_terminal) connected via [serial ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port). Since these terminals did not host software or perform computations themselves, they were not considered *hosts* as they were not connected to any [IP network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_network), and were not assigned IP addresses.

### Servers and nodes

All [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) are hosts, but not all hosts are servers. Any device that has established a connection to a network qualifies as a host, whereas only hosts that accept connections from other devices (clients) qualify as servers.

Every network host is a [network node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_node), but not every network node is a host. [Networking hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware) such as [modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem), [hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub) and [network switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch) are not necessarily assigned network addresses (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and consequently may not be considered to be network hosts.
