# Hostname

## wikipedia [Hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname)

In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking), a **hostname** (archaically **nodename**[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#cite_note-1)) is a label that is assigned to a device connected to a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) and that is used to identify the device in various forms of electronic communication, such as the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). Hostnames may be simple names consisting of a single word or phrase, or they may be structured.

[Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) hostnames may have appended the name of a [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname#cite_note-:0-2) (DNS) domain, separated from the host-specific label by a [period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(punctuation)) ("dot"). In the latter form, a **hostname** is also called a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name). If the **domain name** is completely specified, including a [top-level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) of the Internet, then the hostname is said to be a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) (FQDN). **Hostnames** that include **DNS domains** are often stored in the **Domain Name System** together with the [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of the host they represent for the purpose of mapping the hostname to an address, or the reverse process.

### Example

*saturn* and *jupiter* may be the **hostnames** of two devices connected to a **network** named *example*. Within *example*, the devices are addressed by their **hostnames**. The **domain names** of the devices are *saturn.example* and *jupiter.example*, respectively. If *example* is registered as a **second-level domain name** in the Internet, e.g., as *example.net*, the hosts may be addressed by the fully qualified domain names *saturn.example.net* and *jupiter.example.net*.



### Internet hostnames

In the Internet, a **hostname** is a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) assigned to a host computer. This is usually a combination of the host's local name with its parent domain's name. For example, *en.wikipedia.org* consists of a local hostname (*en*) and the domain name *wikipedia.org*. This kind of hostname is translated into an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) via the local [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file), or the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) resolver. It is possible for a single host computer to have several hostnames; but generally the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) of the host prefers to have one hostname that the host uses for itself.

Any domain name can also be a hostname, as long as the restrictions mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both *en.wikipedia.org* and *wikipedia.org* are hostnames because they both have [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) assigned to them. A hostname may be a domain name, if it is properly organized into the domain name system. A domain name may be a hostname if it has been assigned to an Internet host and associated with the host's IP address.
