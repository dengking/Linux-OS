In [computing](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Computing), a **denial-of-service attack** (**DoS attack**) is a [cyber-attack](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Cyber-attack) in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended [users](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-User_(computing)) by temporarily or indefinitely (无限期地)disrupting [services](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Network_service) of a [host](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Host_(network)) connected to the [Internet](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Internet). Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous(过多的) requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.[[1\]](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Denial-of-service_attack#cite_note-1)

In a **distributed denial-of-service attack** (**DDoS attack**), the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.
