# Sliding window



## wikipedia [Sliding window protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol)

A **sliding window protocol** is a feature of packet-based [data transmission](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Data_transmission) [protocols](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Protocol_(computing)). Sliding window protocols are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, such as in the [data link layer](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Data_link_layer) ([OSI layer 2](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-OSI_model#Layer_2:_Data_Link_Layer)) as well as in the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP). They are also used to improve efficiency when the channel may include high [latency](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Network_delay).
