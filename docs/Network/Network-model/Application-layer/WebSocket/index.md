# wikipedia [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

**WebSocket** is a computer [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol), providing [full-duplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-duplex) communication **channels** over a single [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the [IETF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) as [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) in [Web IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_IDL) is being standardized by the [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium).

**WebSocket** is a different protocol from **HTTP**. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) states that WebSocket "is designed to work over **HTTP** ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries" thus making it compatible with the HTTP protocol. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket [handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking) uses the [HTTP Upgrade header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/1.1_Upgrade_header)[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-1) to change from the HTTP protocol to the **WebSocket protocol**.

The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) (or other client application) and a [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) with lower overheads, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the **server** to send content to the **client** without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server. The communications are done over TCP [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) number 80 (or 443 in the case of [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)-encrypted connections), which is of benefit for those environments which block non-web Internet connections using a [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)). Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap(权宜) technologies such as [Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)).

Most browsers support the protocol, including [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), [Microsoft Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge), [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer), [Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox), [Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)) and [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_web_browser).

## Overview

Unlike HTTP, WebSocket provides full-duplex communication.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-quantum-3) Additionally, WebSocket enables streams of messages on top of TCP. TCP alone deals with streams of bytes with no inherent concept of a message. Before WebSocket, port 80 full-duplex communication was attainable using [Comet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) channels; however, Comet implementation is nontrivial, and due to the TCP handshake and HTTP header overhead, it is inefficient for small messages. The WebSocket protocol aims to solve these problems without compromising security assumptions of the web.

The WebSocket protocol specification defines `ws` (WebSocket) and `wss` (WebSocket Secure) as two new [uniform resource identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier) (URI) schemes[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-4) that are used for unencrypted and encrypted connections, respectively. Apart from the scheme name and [fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_identifier) (`#` is not supported), the rest of the URI components are defined to use [URI generic syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_segment).[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-5)

Using browser developer tools, developers can inspect the WebSocket handshake as well as the WebSocket frames.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#cite_note-6)
