**Bufferbloat** is a cause of high [latency](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Latency_(engineering)) in [packet-switched networks](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Packet-switched_network) caused by excess [buffering](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Buffer_(telecommunication)) of [packets](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Network_packet). Bufferbloat can also cause [packet delay variation](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Packet_delay_variation) (also known as jitter), as well as reduce the overall network [throughput](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Throughput). When a [router](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Router_(computing)) or [switch](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Network_switch) is configured to use excessively large buffers, even very high-speed networks can become practically unusable for many interactive applications like [voice over IP](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Voice_over_IP) (VoIP), [online gaming](https://en.wanweibaike.com/wiki-Online_game), and even ordinary web surfing.
