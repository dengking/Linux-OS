# [SOCKET(7) Linux Programmer's Manual](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html)  

## NAME

​       socket - Linux socket interface

## SYNOPSIS

```C
#include <sys/socket.h>

sockfd = socket(int socket_family, int socket_type, int protocol);
```
## DESCRIPTION

This  manual  page  describes  the Linux networking **socket layer** user interface.  The BSD compatible sockets are the uniform interface  between the **user process** and the **network protocol stacks** in the kernel.  The protocol modules are grouped into **protocol families**  like  `AF_INET`, `AF_IPX`, `AF_PACKET` and **socket types** like `SOCK_STREAM` or `SOCK_DGRAM`.  See `socket(2)` for more information on **families** and **types**.

***SUMMARY*** : 在APUE的16.2 Socket Descriptors中将 `socket(2)` 称之为`domain`，并且`man 2 socket`中，也叫做`domain`，我觉得`domain`更好理解；

### Socket-layer functions

These  functions  are used by the user process to send or receive packets and to do other socket operations.  For more information see their respective manual pages.

[`socket(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html) creates a socket, [`connect(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html) connects a socket to a remote socket address, the [`bind(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bind.2.html) function binds a socket to a **local socket  address**,  [`listen(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/listen.2.html)  tells the socket that new connections shall be accepted, and [`accept(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/accept.2.html) is used to get a new socket with a  new incoming connection.  [`socketpair(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html) returns two connected anonymous sockets (implemented  only  for  a  few  local  families  like `AF_UNIX`)

***SUMMARY*** : 通过[getaddrinfo(3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)将address和port进行结合，得到[struct addrinfo](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)，然后根据[struct addrinfo](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html)来创建socket，bind等，具体实例参见 http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html；

`send(2)`,  `sendto(2)`, and `sendmsg(2)` send data over a socket, and `recv(2)`, `recvfrom(2)`, `recvmsg(2)` receive data from a socket.  `poll(2)` and `select(2)` wait for arriving data or a readiness to send data.  In addition, the standard I/O operations like `write(2)`,  `writev(2)`,  `sendfile(2)`, `read(2)`, and `readv(2)` can be used to read and write data.
    

`getsockname(2)` returns the **local socket address** and `getpeername(2)` returns the **remote socket address**.  `getsockopt(2)` and `setsockopt(2)`  are used to set or get socket layer or protocol options.  `ioctl(2)` can be used to set or read some other options.
    

`close(2)` is used to close a socket.  [`shutdown(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shutdown.2.html) closes parts of a full-duplex socket connection.
    

Seeking, or calling [`pread(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pread.2.html) or [`pwrite(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pwrite.2.html) with a nonzero position is not supported on sockets.
    

It is possible to do **nonblocking I/O** on sockets by setting the `O_NONBLOCK` flag on a **socket file descriptor** using [`fcntl(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html).   Then  all  operations  that would block will (usually) return with `EAGAIN` (operation should be retried later); [`connect(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html) will return `EINPROGRESS`  error.  The user can then wait for various events via [`poll(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html) or [`select(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html).

```

An  alternative  to  `poll(2)`  and `select(2)` is to let the kernel inform the application about events via a `SIGIO` signal.  For that the  `O_ASYNC` flag must be set on a **socket file descriptor** via `fcntl(2)` and a valid **signal handler** for `SIGIO` must be installed  via  [`sigaction(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html).  See the Signals discussion below.

###  Socket address structures

Each **socket domain** has its own format for socket addresses, with a **domain-specific address structure**.  Each of these structures begins  with an integer "family" field (typed as `sa_family_t`) that indicates the type of the address structure.  This allows the various system  calls (e.g., `connect(2)`, `bind(2)`, `accept(2)`, `getsockname(2)`, `getpeername(2)`), which are generic to all **socket domains**, to determine the domain of a particular socket address.

To allow any type of socket address to be passed to interfaces in the sockets API, the type `struct sockaddr` is defined.   The  purpose  of  this type is purely to allow casting of **domain-specific socket address types** to a "generic" type, so as to avoid compiler warnings about type mismatches in calls to the sockets API.
    

In addition, the sockets API provides the data type `struct sockaddr_storage`.  This type  is  suitable  to  accommodate  all  supported  domain-specific  socket  address  structures;  it is large enough and is aligned properly.  (In particular, it is large enough to hold   IPv6 socket addresses.)  The structure includes the following field, which can be used to identify the type of socket address actually  stored in the structure:
    
```
sa_family_t ss_family;
```
The `sockaddr_storage` structure is useful in programs that must handle socket addresses in a generic way (e.g., programs that must deal with both IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses).

### Socket options

The **socket options** listed below can be set by using `setsockopt(2)` and read with `getsockopt(2)` with the socket level set to  `SOL_SOCKET`  for all sockets.  Unless otherwise noted, `optval` is a pointer to an `int`.

#### `SO_ACCEPTCONN`

Returns a value indicating whether or not this socket has been marked to accept connections with `listen(2)`.  The value 0 indicates that this is not a **listening socket**, the value 1 indicates that this is a **listening socket**.  This socket option is  read-only.
    

### `SO_BINDTODEVICE`

Bind  this  socket  to  a  particular device like `eth0` as specified in the passed interface name.  If the name is an empty  string or the option length is zero, the **socket device binding** is removed.  The passed option is a variable-length null-terminated  interface  name  string  with the maximum size of `IFNAMSIZ`.  If a socket is bound to an interface, only packets received  from that particular interface are processed by the socket.  Note that this works only  for  some  socket  types,  particularly  `AF_INET` sockets.  It is not supported for **packet sockets** (use normal `bind(2)` there).
    

Before  Linux  3.8, this socket option could be set, but could not retrieved with getsockopt(2).  Since Linux 3.8, it is readable.  The `optlen` argument should contain the buffer size available to receive the device name and is recommended to be `IFNAMSZ` bytes.  The real device name length is reported back in the `optlen` argument.

### `SO_BROADCAST`

Set or get the **broadcast flag**.  When enabled, **datagram sockets** are allowed to send packets to a **broadcast address**.  This option has no effect on **stream-oriented sockets**.
    

### `SO_BSDCOMPAT`

Enable BSD bug-to-bug compatibility.  This is used by the UDP protocol module in Linux 2.0 and 2.2.   If  enabled  ICMP  errors received  for  a **UDP socket** will not be passed to the user program.  In later kernel versions, support for this option has been phased out: Linux 2.4 silently ignores it, and Linux 2.6 generates a kernel warning (`printk()`) if a program uses  this  option.

Linux  2.0  also  enabled BSD bug-to-bug compatibility options (random header changing, skipping of the broadcast flag) for raw sockets with this option, but that was removed in Linux 2.2.
    

### `SO_DEBUG`

Enable socket debugging.  Only allowed for processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability or an effective user ID of 0.
    

### `SO_DOMAIN` (since Linux 2.6.32)

Retrieves the socket domain as an integer, returning a value such as `AF_INET6`.  See socket(2) for details.  This socket  option  is read-only.
    

### `SO_ERROR`

Get and clear the pending socket error.  This socket option is read-only.  Expects an integer.
​    

### `SO_DONTROUTE`

Don't  send via a gateway, send only to directly connected hosts.  The same effect can be achieved by setting the `MSG_DONTROUTE` flag on a socket `send(2)` operation.  Expects an integer boolean flag.
    

### `SO_KEEPALIVE`

Enable sending of keep-alive messages on connection-oriented sockets.  Expects an integer boolean flag.
    

### `SO_LINGER`

Sets or gets the `SO_LINGER` option.  The argument is a linger structure.
    
```c
struct linger {
    int l_onoff;    /* linger active */
    int l_linger;   /* how many seconds to linger for */
};
```

When enabled, a `close(2)` or `shutdown(2)` will not return until all queued messages for the socket have been successfully sent or the  linger timeout has been reached.  Otherwise, the call returns immediately and the closing is done in the background.  When  the socket is closed as part of exit(2), it always lingers in the background.
    

### `SO_MARK` (since Linux 2.6.25)

​              Set the mark for each packet sent through this socket (similar to the netfilter MARK target but  socket-based).   Changing  the
​              mark  can  be  used  for  mark-based  routing  without  netfilter  or  for  packet filtering.  Setting this option requires the
​              CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
​    

SO_OOBINLINE
              If this option is enabled, out-of-band data is directly placed into the receive data stream.   Otherwise  out-of-band  data  is
              passed only when the MSG_OOB flag is set during receiving.
    
SO_PASSCRED
              Enable or disable the receiving of the SCM_CREDENTIALS control message.  For more information see unix(7).
    
SO_PEEK_OFF (since Linux 3.4)
              This  option, which is currently supported only for unix(7) sockets, sets the value of the "peek offset" for the recv(2) system
              call when used with MSG_PEEK flag.
    
              When this option is set to a negative value (it is set to -1 for all new sockets), traditional behavior  is  provided:  recv(2)
              with the MSG_PEEK flag will peek data from the front of the queue.
    
              When  the option is set to a value greater than or equal to zero, then the next peek at data queued in the socket will occur at
              the byte offset specified by the option value.  At the same time, the "peek offset" will be incremented by the number of  bytes
              that were peeked from the queue, so that a subsequent peek will return the next data in the queue.i
    
              If  data is removed from the front of the queue via a call to recv(2) (or similar) without the MSG_PEEK flag, the "peek offset"
              will be decreased by the number of bytes removed.  In other words, receiving data without the  MSG_PEEK  flag  will  cause  the
              "peek  offset"  to  be  adjusted  to  maintain the correct relative position in the queued data, so that a subsequent peek will
              retrieve the data that would have been retrieved had the data not been removed.
    
              For datagram sockets, if the "peek offset" points to the middle of a  packet,  the  data  returned  will  be  marked  with  the
              MSG_TRUNC flag.
    
              The  following  example  serves  to  illustrate the use of SO_PEEK_OFF.  Suppose a stream socket has the following queued input
              data:
    
                  aabbccddeeff


              The following sequence of recv(2) calls would have the effect noted in the comments:
    
                  int ov = 4;                  // Set peek offset to 4
                  setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_PEEK_OFF, &ov, sizeof(ov));
    
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "cc"; offset set to 6
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "dd"; offset set to 8
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, 0);         // Reads "aa"; offset set to 6
                  recv(fd, buf, 2, MSG_PEEK);  // Peeks "ee"; offset set to 8

### `SO_PEERCRED`

​              Return the credentials of the foreign process connected to this socket.  This is possible only  for  connected  AF_UNIX  stream
​              sockets  and  AF_UNIX  stream and datagram socket pairs created using socketpair(2); see unix(7).  The returned credentials are
​              those that were in effect at the time of the call to connect(2) or socketpair(2).  The argument is a  ucred  structure;  define
​              the  GNU_SOURCE feature test macro to obtain the definition of that structure from <sys/socket.h>.  This socket option is read-
​              only.
​    

### `SO_PRIORITY`

​              Set the protocol-defined priority for all packets to be sent on this socket.  Linux uses this value  to  order  the  networking
​              queues: packets with a higher priority may be processed first depending on the selected device queueing discipline.  For ip(7),
​              this also sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) field for outgoing packets.  Setting a priority outside the range 0 to  6  requires
​              the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
​    

### `SO_PROTOCOL` (since Linux 2.6.32)

​              Retrieves  the  socket protocol as an integer, returning a value such as IPPROTO_SCTP.  See socket(2) for details.  This socket
​              option is read-only.
​    

### `SO_RCVBUF`

Sets or gets the maximum socket **receive buffer** in bytes.  The kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping  overhead) when it is set using `setsockopt(2)`, and this doubled value is returned by `getsockopt(2)`.  The default value is set by the `/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default` file, and the maximum allowed value is set by the `/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max` file.  The minimum (doubled) value for this option is 256.
    

### `SO_RCVBUFFORCE` (since Linux 2.6.14)

Using  this  socket option, a privileged (`CAP_NET_ADMIN`) process can perform the same task as SO_RCVBUF, but the `rmem_max` limit can be overridden.


### `SO_RCVLOWAT` and `SO_SNDLOWAT`

Specify the minimum number of bytes in the **buffer** until the **socket layer** will pass the data to the  **protocol**  (`SO_SNDLOWAT`)  or the user on receiving (`SO_RCVLOWAT`).  These two values are initialized to 1.  `SO_SNDLOWAT` is not changeable on Linux (`setsockopt(2)` fails with the error `ENOPROTOOPT`).  `SO_RCVLOWAT` is changeable only since Linux 2.4. 

Before Linux 2.6.28,  the `select(2)`  and  `poll(2)`  system  calls  currently do not respect the `SO_RCVLOWAT` setting on Linux, and mark a socket readable when even a single byte of data is           available.  A subsequent read from the socket will block until `SO_RCVLOWAT` bytes are available.
***SUMMARY*** : 上面这一段描述是非常不清楚的，可以参见[A](https://www.zhihu.com/question/28594409/answer/52763082)



### `SO_RCVTIMEO` and `SO_SNDTIMEO`

Specify the receiving or sending timeouts until reporting an error.  The argument is a `struct timeval`.  If an input  or  output function  blocks  for  this  period  of time, and data has been sent or received, the return value of that function will be the  amount of data transferred; if no data has been transferred and the timeout has been reached then -1 is returned with `errno` set to `EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`, or `EINPROGRESS` (for `connect(2)`)  just as if the socket was specified to be **nonblocking**.  If the timeout is set to zero (the default) then the operation will never timeout.  Timeouts only have effect for system calls that  perform  socket  I/O  (e.g.,  `read(2)`,  `recvmsg(2)`,  `send(2)`,  `sendmsg(2)`);  timeouts  have  no  effect  for  `select(2)`,  `poll(2)`,  `epoll_wait(2)`, and so on.


### `SO_REUSEADDR`

Indicates that the rules used in validating addresses supplied in a `bind(2)` call should allow reuse of  local  addresses.   For  `AF_INET`  sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when there is an active listening socket bound to the address.  When  the listening socket is bound to `INADDR_ANY` with a specific port then it is not possible to bind to this  port  for  any  local  address.  Argument is an integer boolean flag.
    

### `SO_SNDBUF`

​              Sets  or gets the maximum socket send buffer in bytes.  The kernel doubles this value (to allow space for bookkeeping overhead)
​              when it is set using setsockopt(2), and this doubled value is returned by getsockopt(2).  The  default  value  is  set  by  the
​              /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default file and the maximum allowed value is set by the /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max file.  The minimum
​              (doubled) value for this option is 2048.
​    

### `SO_SNDBUFFORCE` (since Linux 2.6.14)

​              Using this socket option, a privileged (CAP_NET_ADMIN) process can perform the same task as SO_SNDBUF, but the  wmem_max  limit
​              can be overridden.
​    

### `SO_TIMESTAMP`

​              Enable  or  disable  the  receiving  of  the  SO_TIMESTAMP  control  message.  The timestamp control message is sent with level
​              SOL_SOCKET and the cmsg_data field is a struct timeval indicating the reception time of the last packet passed to the  user  in
​              this call.  See cmsg(3) for details on control messages.
​    

### `SO_TYPE`

​              Gets the socket type as an integer (e.g., SOCK_STREAM).  This socket option is read-only.

## Signals

 When writing onto a connection-oriented socket that has been shut down (by the local or the remote end) `SIGPIPE` is sent to the writing process and `EPIPE` is returned.  The signal is not sent when the write call specified the `MSG_NOSIGNAL` flag.

When requested with the `FIOSETOWN` `fcntl(2)` or `SIOCSPGRP` `ioctl(2)`, `SIGIO` is sent when an I/O event  occurs.   It  is  possible  to  use `poll(2)`  or `select(2)` in the signal handler to find out which socket the event occurred on.  An alternative (in Linux 2.2) is to set a real-time signal using the `F_SETSIG` `fcntl(2)`; the handler of the real time signal will be called with the file descriptor in the `si_fd` field of its `siginfo_t`.  See `fcntl(2)` for more information.

Under  some  circumstances  (e.g., multiple processes accessing a single socket), the condition that caused the `SIGIO` may have already disappeared when the process reacts to the signal.  If this happens, the process should wait again because Linux will resend the signal later.

##    /proc interfaces

​       The core socket networking parameters can be accessed via files in the directory /proc/sys/net/core/.

       rmem_default
              contains the default setting in bytes of the socket receive buffer.
    
       rmem_max
              contains the maximum socket receive buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using the SO_RCVBUF socket option.
    
       wmem_default
              contains the default setting in bytes of the socket send buffer.
    
       wmem_max
              contains the maximum socket send buffer size in bytes which a user may set by using the SO_SNDBUF socket option.
    
       message_cost and message_burst
              configure the token bucket filter used to load limit warning messages caused by external network events.
    
       netdev_max_backlog
              Maximum number of packets in the global input queue.
    
       optmem_max
              Maximum length of ancillary data and user control data like the iovecs per socket.

   Ioctls
       These operations can be accessed using ioctl(2):

           error = ioctl(ip_socket, ioctl_type, &value_result);
    
       SIOCGSTAMP
              Return  a  struct  timeval with the receive timestamp of the last packet passed to the user.  This is useful for accurate round
              trip time measurements.  See setitimer(2) for a description of struct timeval.  This ioctl should be used only  if  the  socket
              option  SO_TIMESTAMP  is not set on the socket.  Otherwise, it returns the timestamp of the last packet that was received while
              SO_TIMESTAMP was not set, or it fails if no such packet has been received,  (i.e.,  ioctl(2)  returns  -1  with  errno  set  to
              ENOENT).
    
       SIOCSPGRP
              Set  the  process or process group to send SIGIO or SIGURG signals to when an asynchronous I/O operation has finished or urgent
              data is available.  The argument is a pointer to a pid_t.  If the argument is positive, send the signals to that  process.   If
              the argument is negative, send the signals to the process group with the ID of the absolute value of the argument.  The process
              may only choose itself or its own process group to receive signals unless it has the CAP_KILL capability or an effective UID of
              0.
    
       FIOASYNC
              Change  the  O_ASYNC flag to enable or disable asynchronous I/O mode of the socket.  Asynchronous I/O mode means that the SIGIO
              signal or the signal set with F_SETSIG is raised when a new I/O event occurs.
    
              Argument is an integer boolean flag.  (This operation is synonymous with the use of fcntl(2) to set the O_ASYNC flag.)
    
       SIOCGPGRP
              Get the current process or process group that receives SIGIO or SIGURG signals, or 0 when none is set.
    
       Valid fcntl(2) operations:
    
       FIOGETOWN
              The same as the SIOCGPGRP ioctl(2).
    
       FIOSETOWN
              The same as the SIOCSPGRP ioctl(2).

VERSIONS
       SO_BINDTODEVICE was introduced in Linux 2.0.30.  SO_PASSCRED is new in Linux 2.2.  The /proc interfaces was introduced in  Linux  2.2.
       SO_RCVTIMEO  and SO_SNDTIMEO are supported since Linux 2.3.41.  Earlier, timeouts were fixed to a protocol-specific setting, and could
       not be read or written.

NOTES
       Linux assumes that half of the send/receive buffer is used for internal kernel structures; thus the values in the corresponding  /proc
       files are twice what can be observed on the wire.

       Linux  will  only allow port reuse with the SO_REUSEADDR option when this option was set both in the previous program that performed a
       bind(2) to the port and in the program that wants to reuse the port.  This differs from some  implementations  (e.g.,  FreeBSD)  where
       only  the  later  program  needs to set the SO_REUSEADDR option.  Typically this difference is invisible, since, for example, a server
       program is designed to always set this option.

BUGS
       The CONFIG_FILTER socket options SO_ATTACH_FILTER and SO_DETACH_FILTER are not documented.  The suggested interface to use them is via
       the libpcap library.
