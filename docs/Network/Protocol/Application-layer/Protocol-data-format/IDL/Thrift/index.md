# Apache Thrift 

在阅读cnblogs [软件开发中的几种数据交换协议](https://www.cnblogs.com/winner-0715/p/7693400.html)时，其中有关于Thrift的介绍。

## wikipedia [Apache Thrift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift)

Thrift is an **interface definition language** and **binary communication protocol** used for defining and creating services for numerous programming languages. It forms a **remote procedure call framework**(RPC) and was developed at Facebook for "**scalable cross-language services development**". It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build **cross-platform services** which can connect applications written in a variety of languages and frameworks, including ActionScript, C, C++, C#, Cappuccino, Cocoa, Delphi, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Elixir, Rust, Smalltalk and Swift. It was developed at Facebook and it is now an open source project in the Apache Software Foundation. The implementation was described in an April 2007 technical paper released by Facebook, now hosted on Apache.
