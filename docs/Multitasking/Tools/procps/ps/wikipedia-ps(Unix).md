# [ps (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps_(Unix))

In most [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_systems), the **ps** program (short for "**p**rocess **s**tatus") displays the currently-running [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)). A related Unix utility named [top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software)) provides a real-time view of the running processes.

In [Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell), `ps` is a predefined [command alias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(command)) for the `Get-Process` cmdlet, which essentially serves the same purpose.

## Examples

For example:

```shell
# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 7431 pts/0    00:00:00 su
 7434 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
18585 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

Users can also utilize the `ps` command in conjunction with the [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) command (see the [`pgrep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgrep) and [`pkill`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgrep) commands) to find information about a single process, such as its id:

```shell
$ # Trying to find the PID of `firefox-bin` which is 2701
$ ps -A | grep firefox-bin
2701 ?        22:16:04 firefox-bin
```

The use of `pgrep` simplifies the syntax and avoids potential [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition):

```shell
$ pgrep -l firefox-bin
2701 firefox-bin
```

To see every process running as root in user format:

```shell
# ps -U root -u
USER   PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TT  STAT STARTED        TIME COMMAND
root     1   0.0  0.0   9436   128  -  ILs  Sun00AM     0:00.12 /sbin/init --
```

## Options

`ps` has many options. On [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) that support the [SUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification) and [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) standards, `ps` commonly runs with the options **-ef**, where "-e" selects **e**very process and "-f" chooses the "**f**ull" output format. Another common option on these systems is **-l**, which specifies the "**l**ong" output format.

Most systems derived from [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD) fail to accept the SUS and POSIX standard options because of historical conflicts. (For example, the "e" or "-e" option will display [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable).) On such systems, `ps` commonly runs with the non-standard options **aux**, where "a" lists all processes on a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal), including those of other users, "x" lists all processes without [controlling terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controlling_terminal&action=edit&redlink=1) and "u" adds a column for the controlling user for each process. For maximum compatibility, there is no "-" in front of the "aux". "ps auxww" provides complete information about the process, including all parameters.
