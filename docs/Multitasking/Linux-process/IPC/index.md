### Approaches

|                            Method                            |                      Short Description                       | Provided by ([operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) or other environments) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|     [File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)      | A record stored on disk, or a record synthesized on demand by a file server, which can be accessed by multiple processes. |                    Most operating systems                    |
|                     Communications file                      | A unique form of IPC in the late-1960s that most closely resembles [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs)'s [9P protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9P_(protocol)) | [Dartmouth Time-Sharing System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Time-Sharing_System) |
| [Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(computing)); also [Asynchronous System Trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_System_Trap) | A system message sent from one process to another, not usually used to transfer data but instead used to remotely command the partnered process. |                    Most operating systems                    |
|    [Socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket)    | Data sent over a network interface, either to a different process on the same computer or to another computer on the network. Stream-oriented ([TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol); data written through a socket requires formatting to preserve message boundaries) or more rarely message-oriented ([UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol), [SCTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTP)). |                    Most operating systems                    |
| [Unix domain socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) | Similar to an internet socket, but all communication occurs within the kernel. Domain sockets use the file system as their address space. Processes reference a domain socket as an [inode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode), and multiple processes can communicate with one socket | All POSIX operating systems and Windows 10[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication#cite_note-3) |
| [Message queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) | A data stream similar to a socket, but which usually preserves message boundaries. Typically implemented by the operating system, they allow multiple processes to read and write to the [message queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue) without being directly connected to each other. |                    Most operating systems                    |
| [Anonymous pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe) | A unidirectional data channel using [standard input and output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdin). Data written to the write-end of the pipe is buffered by the operating system until it is read from the read-end of the pipe. Two-way communication between processes can be achieved by using two pipes in opposite "directions". | All [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) systems, Windows |
|    [Named pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe)    | A pipe that is treated like a file. Instead of using standard input and output as with an anonymous pipe, processes write to and read from a named pipe, as if it were a regular file. |           All POSIX systems, Windows, AmigaOS 2.0+           |
| [Shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory_(interprocess_communication)) | Multiple processes are given access to the same block of [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_(computing)), which creates a shared buffer for the processes to communicate with each other. |                  All POSIX systems, Windows                  |
| [Message passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) | Allows multiple programs to communicate using message queues and/or non-OS managed channels. Commonly used in concurrency models. | Used in [LPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Inter-Process_Communication), [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), [RMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_method_invocation), and [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) paradigms, [Java RMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_RMI), [CORBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORBA), [COM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model), [DDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Distribution_Service), [MSMQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Message_Queuing), [MailSlots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailSlot), [QNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX), others |
| [Memory-mapped file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) | A file mapped to [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM) and can be modified by changing memory addresses directly instead of outputting to a stream. This shares the same benefits as a standard [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(computing)). |                  All POSIX systems, Windows                  |
