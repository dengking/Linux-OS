In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a **code segment**, also known as a **text segment** or simply as **text**, is a portion of an [object file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file) or the corresponding section of the program's [virtual address space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space) that contains [executable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable) [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_(computer_science)).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_segment#cite_note-jason-1) The term "segment" comes from the [memory segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segment), which is a historical approach to [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management) that has been succeeded by [paging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging).
