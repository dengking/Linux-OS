# [10.13 Registers](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Registers.html#Registers)



## `info registers`



## `info all-registers`





GDB has four “standard” register names that are available (in expressions) on most machines—whenever they do not conflict with an architecture’s canonical mnemonics(助记符) for registers. 

| Register name | Register                                                    | Reference                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$pc`         | program counter register                                    | wikipedia [Program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter)<br> |
| `$sp`         | stack pointer                                               | wikipedia [Stack register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register) |
| `$fp`         | register that contains a pointer to the current stack frame |                                                              |
| `$ps`         | register that contains the processor status                 |                                                              |

For example, you could print the program counter in hex with

```shell
p/x $pc
```

or print the instruction to be executed next with

```shell
x/i $pc
```

or add four to the stack pointer[12](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Registers.html#FOOT12) with

```shell
set $sp += 4
```
